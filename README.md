#Description:
This Python code consists of multiple functions designed to perform various tasks, such as updating Aadhar card details, a travel diary program, multiplication game, cubic game, factorial game, Fibonacci number generator, heads and tails game, dice game, double dice game, password generator, countdown timer, and a quiz game.
Furthermore, the code also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the tkinter library which allows the user to interact with and choose which program to run. The interface shows button options for each of the tasks mentioned above.
Overall, this code showcases a diverse range of applications and a user-friendly way to access and use them through a GUI.
